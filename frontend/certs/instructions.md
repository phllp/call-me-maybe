Run the following command inside of this directory in order to generate the SSL certificates

```bash
mkcert localhost
```

If you dont have mkcert installed yet, [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).
Don't forget to run `mkcert -install`, to install a root certificate in your computer so browsers will trust your certificates.
